/* Objects-> An object is a unique entity that containe properties and methods.
             An object is an instance of a class.
             The object can be created in two ways 
             .Object literals
             .Object Constructor */
//Using Objects Literals:-
// Defining object
let person = {
	first_name: 'Mukul',
	last_name: 'Latiyan',

	//method
	getFunction: function () {
		return (`The name of the person is
		${person.first_name} ${person.last_name}`)
	},
	//object within object
	phone_number: {
		mobile: '12345',
		landline: '6789'
	}
}
console.log(person.getFunction());
console.log(person.phone_number.landline);

//Using Constructor:-
  // Using a constructor
function person(first_name, last_name) {
	this.first_name = first_name;
	this.last_name = last_name;
}
// Creating new instances of person object
let person1 = new person('Mukul', 'Latiyan');
let person2 = new person('Rahul', 'Avasthi');

console.log(person1.first_name);
console.log(`${person2.first_name} ${person2.last_name}`);



/*Classes
  Classes are blueprints of an Object. A class can have many Objects because the class is a template while Objects are instances of the class or the concrete implementation. 
Before we move further into implementation, we should know unlike other Object Oriented languages there are no classes in JavaScript we have only Object. To be more precise, JavaScript is a prototype-based Object Oriented Language, which means it doesnâ€™t have classes, rather it defines behaviors using a constructor function and then reuses it using the prototype. 
*/
// Defining class using es6
class Vehicle {
	constructor(name, maker, engine) {
		this.name = name;
		this.maker = maker;
		this.engine = engine;
	}
	getDetails() {
		return (`The name of the bike is ${this.name}.`)
	}
}
// Making object with the help of the constructor
let bike1 = new Vehicle('Hayabusa', 'Suzuki', '1340cc');
let bike2 = new Vehicle('Ninja', 'Kawasaki', '998cc');

console.log(bike1.name); // Hayabusa
console.log(bike2.maker); // Kawasaki
console.log(bike1.getDetails());

//
// Defining class in a Traditional Way.
function Vehicle(name, maker, engine) {
	this.name = name,
		this.maker = maker,
		this.engine = engine
};

Vehicle.prototype.getDetails = function () {
	console.log('The name of the bike is ' + this.name);
}

let bike1 = new Vehicle('Hayabusa', 'Suzuki', '1340cc');
let bike2 = new Vehicle('Ninja', 'Kawasaki', '998cc');

console.log(bike1.name);
console.log(bike2.maker);
console.log(bike1.getDetails());


// Abstraction in Javascript

/* Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details 
   Data Abstraction means providing only essential information to the outside world and
   hiding the background details and other essential information. */
// Abstraction example
function person(fname, lname) {
	let firstname = fname;
	let lastname = lname;

	let getDetails_noaccess = function () {
		return (`First name is: ${firstname} Last
			name is: ${lastname}`);
	}

	this.getDetails_access = function () {
		return (`First name is: ${firstname}, Last
			name is: ${lastname}`);
	}
}
let person1 = new person('Mukul', 'Latiyan');
console.log(person1.firstname);
console.log(person1.getDetails_noaccess);
console.log(person1.getDetails_access());
   



//Encapsulation in Javascript

/* The process of wrapping properties and functions within a single unit is known as encapsulation */

// Encapsulation example
class person {
	constructor(name, id) {
		this.name = name;
		this.id = id;
	}
	add_Address(add) {
		this.add = add;
	}
	getDetails() {
		console.log(`Name is ${this.name},
		Address is: ${this.add}`);
	}
}

let person1 = new person('Mukul', 21);
person1.add_Address('Delhi');
person1.getDetails();

 

//Inheritance

/*It is a concept in which some properties and methods of an Object are being used by another Object. Unlike most of the OOP languages where classes inherit classes, JavaScript Objects inherit Objects i.e. certain features (property and methods) of one object can be reused by other Objects. */
// Inheritance example
class person {
	constructor(name) {
		this.name = name;
	}
	// method to return the string
	toString() {
		return (`Name of person: ${this.name}`);
	}
}
class student extends person {
	constructor(name, id) {
		// super keyword for calling the above
		// class constructor
		super(name);
		this.id = id;
	}
	toString() {
		return (`${super.toString()},
		Student ID: ${this.id}`);
	}
}
let student1 = new student('Mukul', 22);
console.log(student1.toString());


//The Person and Student objects both have the same method (i.e toString()), this is called Method Overriding. Method Overriding allows a method in a child class to have the same name(polymorphism) and method signature as that of a parent class. 

/* Polymorphism

 Polymorphism is one of the core concepts of object-oriented programming languages. Polymorphism means the same function with different signatures is called many times. In real life, for example, a boy at the same time may be a student, a class monitor, etc. So a boy can perform different operations at the same time. Polymorphism can be achieved by method overriding and method overloading
